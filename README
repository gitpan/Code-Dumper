Code-Dumper version 0.01
========================

Surround code with the Code::Dumper comments and your code will be:

  * executed as normal
  * diaged as well (see Test::More)

Debugging can be fun. However after *too many* print statements and Data::Dumpers have been sprinked all around, lets face it... it can do your head in. Code::Dumper is a module that attempts to bring back debugging context and your sanity.
